MT-SICS commands do not work with Q3 Dosing module or the XPR Automatic Balance. If you want to control the operation of the Q3 dosing module remotely and then you need to use Web Service. Refer the following link for documentation:
www.mt.com/global/en/home/library/technical-specifications/laboratory-weighing/web-service-how-to-guide.html 

The web service documentation contains information on how to set up the web service, a description of the sample project, and a detailed WSDL reference. Further we recommend that the customer should take assistance from a programmer (at their end) to configure webservices. i.e. we strongly recommend our customers to turn to external specialists if they do not have the right resources internally to setup the communication.

In case the external programmer has error, you can write to us providing complete details Balance Model. SNR, Software version, Support file and the relevant error images we may then assist further. However, for a programmer the documentation is self-explanatory and sufficient to setup the system functioning.
